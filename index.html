            <h2 class="heading-section">Biography</h2>
            <p class="text-section" id="tribute-info">Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March, 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the
                predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the Netherlands. He was the oldest surviving
                child of Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and his wife Anna Cornelia
                Carbentus. Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child. He was taught at home by his mother and a
                governess and in 1860 was sent to the village school. His interest in art began at a young age.</p>
            <p class="text-section">As a young man, he worked as an art dealer, often traveling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially; the two kept a long correspondence by letter.</p>
            <p class="text-section">Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried
                about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression persisted, and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a revolver, dying from his injuries two days later.</p>

            <p class="text-section">Van Gogh drew, and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few
                examples survived. When he took up art as an adult, he
                began at an elementary level. He experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters and
                different drawing materials. After Theo criticised <em>The Potato Eaters</em> for its dark palette
                he tried
                to master a new, lighter palette. Van Gogh
                strove to be a painter of rural life and nature, and during
                his first summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and traditional rural life.</p>
            <p class="text-section">Van Gogh's stylistic developments
                are usually linked to the periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined
                to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly
                individual visual outlook throughout. He perceived colour as having a "psychological and moral
                weight". Yellow meant the most to him, because it symbolised emotional truth.</p>
            <p class="text-section">He stayed within what he called the "guise of reality", and was critical of
                overly stylised works. Van Gogh was influenced by Blanc's definition of style, that a true painting
                required optimal use of colour, perspective and brushstrokes. He applied the word "purposeful" to
                paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-section">Legacy</h2>
            <p class="text-section">After Van Gogh's first exhibitions in the late 1880s, his reputation grew
                steadily among artists, art critics, dealers and collectors. In 1889, his work was described in the
                journal
                <em>Le Moderniste Illustré</em> by Albert Aurier as characterised by "fire, intensity, sunshine".
                After Van Gogh's death, memorial exhibitions were held in Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp. His work was shown in several high-profile exhibitions.</p>
            <p class="text-section">Van Gogh's fame reached its first peak in Austria and Germany before World War I,
                helped by the publication of his letters in three volumes in 1914. His letters are expressive and literate, and have been described as among the foremost 19th-century
                writings of their kind. These began a compelling mythology of Van Gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young.</p>
            <p class="text-section">His nephew and namesake, Vincent Willem van Gogh, inherited the
                estate after his mother's death in 1925. During the early 1950s he arranged for the
                publication of a complete edition of the letters presented in four volumes and several languages. He
                then began negotiations with the Dutch government to subsidise a foundation to purchase and house the entire collection. The
                Van Gogh Museum opened in the Museumplein in Amsterdam in 1973. It became the second most popular museum in the Netherlands, after the Rijksmuseum. Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings.</p>
